# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

## Introduction

It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal
movement using activity monitoring devices such as a
[Fitbit](http://www.fitbit.com), [Nike
Fuelband](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/c/nikeplus-fuelband), or
[Jawbone Up](https://jawbone.com/up). These type of devices are part of
the "quantified self" movement -- a group of enthusiasts who take
measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to
find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But
these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data are hard to
obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for
processing and interpreting the data.

This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring
device. This device collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the
day. The data consists of two months of data from an anonymous
individual collected during the months of October and November, 2012
and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.

## Data

The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web
site:

* Dataset: [Activity monitoring data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip) [52K]

The variables included in this dataset are:

* **steps**: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing
    values are coded as `NA`)

* **date**: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD
    format

* **interval**: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which
    measurement was taken

The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there
are a total of 17,568 observations in this
dataset.

## Loading and preprocessing the data

In this step, we simply unzip the included activity.zip file and read it into the variable "data" using the following script:


```r
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

and then look at a summary of the data we've imported:


```r
summary(data)
```

```
##      steps                date          interval     
##  Min.   :  0.00   2012-10-01:  288   Min.   :   0.0  
##  1st Qu.:  0.00   2012-10-02:  288   1st Qu.: 588.8  
##  Median :  0.00   2012-10-03:  288   Median :1177.5  
##  Mean   : 37.38   2012-10-04:  288   Mean   :1177.5  
##  3rd Qu.: 12.00   2012-10-05:  288   3rd Qu.:1766.2  
##  Max.   :806.00   2012-10-06:  288   Max.   :2355.0  
##  NA's   :2304     (Other)   :15840
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

From the above summary, we can see that there are 288 rows per date, since the data was recorded at 5 minute intervals. In order to tell the mean per day, we'll need to first transform the data. 

In this step, we'll combine the data for each date by summing steps per date, leaving NA values out, and dropping the interval column.

## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
